Question :-

Imagine a tollbooth with a class called TollBooth. The two data items are of
type unsigned int and double to hold the total number of cars and total
amount of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these data
members to 0. A member function called payingCar()increments the car total
and adds 0.5 to the cash total. Another function called nonPayCar()  increments
the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally a member function 
called display()shows the two totals. Include a program to test this class. 
This program should allow the user to push one key to count a paying car and 
another to count a non paying car. Pushing the ESC key should cause the program to
print out the total number of cars and total cash and then exit.

SOURCE CODE :

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class TollBooth{
    private:
    int totalCars;
    double totalCash;
    public:
    TollBooth(){
        totalCars=0;
        totalCash=0.0;
    }
    void payingCars(){
        totalCars++;
        totalCash+=0.50;
    }
    void nonPayingCars(){
        totalCars++;
    }
    void display(){
        cout<<"Total number of cars: "<<totalCars <<endl;
        cout<<"Total cash collected : "<< totalCash <<endl;
    }
};

int main(){
    TollBooth tollbooth;
    char choice;
    do{
        cout<< "Press (P - Paid , N - Not Paid , Esc - Display , Q - Quit)->";
        cin>> choice;

        switch(choice){
            case 'P':
            tollbooth.payingCars();
            break;
            case 'N':
            tollbooth.nonPayingCars();
            break;
            case 27:
            tollbooth.display();
            break;
            case 'Q':
            cout<<"Exit successful"<<endl;
            break;
            default:
            cout<<"Invalid choice."<<endl;
        }
    }
    while(choice !='Q');
    return 0;
}
